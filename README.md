Ionic 2 Button Click Issue
==========================

Steps to reproduce - See Video 1

- The app has one button which when clicked will show an alert
- Click the button and click to close the alert
- Then click the button again
- The alert is shown a first time. Click to close it
- The alert is shown a second time.

Please note that after clicking the button the first time and closing the alert, if you click anywhere else on the app except for on the button, the alert is again shown, but this time only once - See Video 2

- Click the button and click to close the alert
- Then click anywhere except on the button
- The alert is shown again even though the button was not clicked.
